large fragment of rock or metal from space. A meteorite consists of debris that
is large enough to pass through the Earth’s atmosphere and reach the
planet’s surface without burning up. Scientists believe that meteorites are
fragments of small rocky bodies called asteroids.</span></font>

large METEOR that survives the intense heat of atmospheric friction and reaches
the earth's surface. Meteorites may have originated as fragments of asteroids.
They are classified in three general categories. The siderites, or irons, are
composed entirely of metal (chiefly nickel and iron). The aerolites, or stony
meteorites, show a diversity of mineral elements including large percentages of
silicon and magnesium oxides; the most abundant type of aerolite is the
chondrite, so called because the metal embedded in it is in the form of
grainlike lumps, or chondrules. The siderolites, or stony irons, which are rarer
than the other types, are of both metal and stone in varying proportions. When a
meteorite reaches the earth, the tremendous force of impact with the earth's
surface causes great compression, heating, and partial vaporization of the outer
part of the meteorite and of the materials in the ground; expansion of the gases
thus formed and of steam produced from groundwater causes an explosion that
shatters the meteorite and carves out a meteorite crater in the ground. One of
the best-preserved craters is Meteor, or Barringer, Crater, near Winslow,
Arizona, c.3/4 mi (1 1/2 km ) in diameter and 600 ft (180 m) deep. In N central
Argentina, near Río Cuarto, an unusual series of 10 oblong craters formed by a
meteorite striking the earth at a low angle extends over 30 mi (50 km); the
longest crater is about 2.5 mi (4 km) in length. The largest meteorite ever
discovered, the 60-ton Hoba West, rests where it was found (in 1920), near
Grootfontein, Namibia.</font></span></p>
