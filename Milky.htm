<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">Our
galaxy, the Milky Way, is a spiral galaxy made up of stars, gas, and dust. When
you look up into the night sky, every star you see belongs to our galaxy. Our
Solar System exists in one of the arms of stars that spiral out from the centre
of the galaxy, called the Orion arm. The Sun in our Solar System is just one of
the 100 billion stars that are constantly travelling around the centre of the
galaxy.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
Milky Way, contains a total of about 500 billion stars. It formed from a huge
cloud of gas and dust about 10 billion years ago. At the centre is a dense,
spherical nucleus of stars that may also contain a black hole. A disk of spiral
arms containing hot young stars encircles the nucleus. The nucleus and disk are
surrounded by a sparsely populated halo of very old stars.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
galaxy’s nucleus is about 10,000 light years in diameter. The disk is about
100,000 light years in diameter and 1,000 light years thick. Lastly the halo is
about 50,000 light years in diameter. The Solar System (including the Öpik-Oort
Cloud, a huge region of space populated only by comets) seems relatively small
at only 3 light years across. The Sun takes about 250 million years to orbit the
centre of the Galaxy at a speed of about 220&nbsp;km per second. The Sun has
made between 15 and 20 orbits so far.<o:p>
