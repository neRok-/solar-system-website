than 90 per cent of asteroids in the Solar System are in the asteroid belt.
These follow orbits around the Sun that take between 3 and 6 years to complete.<o:p>

may be carbonaceous, stony, or metallic. Scientists think the asteroids would
probably have stuck together to form a planet had they not been prevented from
doing so by Jupiter’s powerful gravitational field. The total mass of all the
asteroids combined is probably less than one-thousandth that of the Earth or
one-twentieth that of the Moon. In celestial terms, asteroids are very small
objects.<o:p>

at 933&nbsp;km across, is the largest-known asteroid and the first to have been
discovered, in 1801. It is an unusually large asteroid. Most asteroids are no
larger than 250&nbsp;km across. It has been estimated that nearly 1 billion
asteroids are wider than 1&nbsp;km. Those with a diameter greater than about 300&nbsp;km
are spherical. Smaller asteroids are irregularly shaped. The smallest asteroids
are specks of dust, no greater in diameter than a pinhead.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">Asteroids
are numbered according to the order in which their orbits became known. The
larger asteroids are also named, usually by their discoverer. The rest are
generally classified in groups, and each group follows a different orbit. The
Trojans are two collections of exceptionally dark asteroids that follow
Jupiter’s orbit. One subgroup orbits ahead of Jupiter, the other behind. The
Amor, Apollo, and Aten groups contain asteroids that orbit closer to Earth.<o:p>

names were taken from mythology and were usually feminine (for example Vesta,
Pallas, and Juno). As mythological sources were exhausted, names of states,
cities, colleges, composers, writers, astronauts, and so on, were used. Today
anything goes with asteroid names: there is even one, Asteroid 2309, that is
named Mr. Spock for the famous character in the television series, Star Trek.<o:p>

asteroids can be observed through telescopes. In good viewing conditions, Vesta,
the fourth-largest asteroid at 501&nbsp;km in diameter, is visible even to the
naked eye. From the Earth, most asteroids appear as tiny points of light. To be
studied in detail, an asteroid must either come relatively close to the Earth or
be visited by a space probe.</span><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

lies between the orbits of the planets Mars and Jupiter. Asteroids are lumps of
rock or metal that were left over after the Solar System formed. They vary
greatly in size – from 933 kilometres to only a few centimetres in diameter.
Occasionally, some fragments of asteroids survive the passage through the
Earth’s atmosphere and reach the Earth’s surface. They are called <a href="meteorites.htm">meteorites</a></o:p>.
