sun is a 5-billion year old main sequence star. It is a sphere composed mainly
of hydrogen and helium gases, about 1.4 million kilometres in diameter. Four
distinct layers surround the sun’s core. These are the radiation zone, the
convection zone, the photosphere, and the chromosphere. In the core, where
temperatures reach 15 million °C, nuclear reactions convert mass into
electromagnetic radiation, a form of energy. The radiation takes 2 million years
to travel from the Sun’s core to the photosphere, where it is emitted into
space in the form of light, infrared radiation (heat), ultraviolet radiation,
and other forms of energy.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
Sun is an unremarkable star situated close to the edge of one of the arms of our
galaxy called the Orion arm. It looks so bright simply because it is so near to
us, appearing 400,000 times brighter than the full Moon. Its diameter is 1.4&nbsp;million
km, more than 100 times the diameter of the Earth. The Sun has seven times the
mass of the average star and contains 750 times the mass of all its planets put
together.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
Sun is an entirely gaseous body. Approximately 60 per cent of its mass is in the
form of hydrogen gas, and the rest is mainly helium gas. In the Sun’s core,
hydrogen nuclei fuse to form helium nuclei by nuclear fusion. In the process 0.7
per cent of the mass being fused is converted into energy. Of the 600 million
tonnes of hydrogen that fuse in the Sun’s core each second, 4 million tonnes
are converted to energy. It has been calculated that the Sun’s hydrogen fuel
will last for another 5 billion years.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
energy produced in the Sun’s core travels outwards through a layer called the
radiation zone by a process of continous absorption and re-emission by the dense
gases that form this layer. Within the convection zone, which surrounds the
radiation zone, the energy flows outwards through a different mechanism. Masses
of gas rise to the surface, radiate away both heat and light, and then cool and
sink back again.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
visible surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, has a temperature of about
6,000°C and is only a few hundred kilometres thick. Because most of the Sun’s
light output that reaches us comes from the photosphere, the Sun appears to have
a relatively sharp edge. In reality there is no definite surface to the Sun, but
rather a gradual fading away of the gaseous matter into space. Surrounding the
photosphere is the chromosphere, a layer of reddish-pink gas, and the corona,
which only becomes visible during a total solar eclipses.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
Sun rotates about its own axis at different rates depending on latitude. This
rotation creates a magnetic field. Because the Sun’s equatorial region spins
faster than its polar regions, the magnetic field lines become wound up inside
the Sun. If they break through the photosphere, the magnetic lines cause solar
activity such as sunspots, flares, and prominences. This activity, particularly
that of the sunspots, tends to follow an 11-year cycle.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">Sunspots
are relatively cool regions on the Sun’s surface, caused by magnetic fields
that prevent hot material reaching the surface from inside. The central part of
a sunspot, the umbra, has a temperature of about 4,200°C, which is about 1,500°C
cooler than the surrounding solar photosphere. Although the sunspots are glowing
with heat, they appear dark against their hotter, brighter surroundings.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">Violent
solar activity often occurs near sunspots. Solar flares are “flashes” of
energy that may last for several hours. They occur when a massive build up of
magnetic energy is suddenly released. Some of them cause disturbances in the
Earth’s upper atmosphere. Prominences are eruptions of flaming gas that may
shoot hundreds of thousands of kilometres into space. Looped prominences may
remain suspended by the solar magnetic field for weeks at a time.</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-AU"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">The
outermost layer of the Sun’s atmosphere, the corona, is not static but is
continually expanding and giving off a stream of electrically charged particles
into space. This material is called the solar wind and consists of protons,
electrons, and ions (electrically charged atoms). This material is ejected from
the Sun at average speeds of about 450 kilometres per second and bathes the
whole of the Solar System. Among other effects, the solar wind distorts the
Earth’s magnetic field and is responsible for the gas tails of comets as they
approach the Sun.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">It
has been calculated that the Sun loses about 1.1 million tonnes of hydrogen into
the solar wind every second. It would take about 100,000 billion years for the
solar wind to disperse the entire mass of the Sun into interplanetary space.
However, the Sun’s natural life span is only about 10 billion years.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-AU" style="font-size: 12.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line"><font face="Berlin Sans FB">Although
the Sun was formed around 5 billion years ago, it probably reached its present
temperature and brightness only about 500 million years ago. No great change is
expected to occur in its size and brightness for at least 1.45 billion years. In
about 5 billion years’ time, most of the hydrogen in the Sun's core will have
fused to form helium. Gravity will then make the core contract, which will
increase its pressure and temperature. Hydrogen will start to “burn” in a
shell around the core. The new energy generated by nuclear fusion in the shell
will cause the Sun's outer layers to swell until the star becomes a huge red
giant. Its diameter will increase by at least 150 times. The expanded gases will
fade from hot yellow to cooler red. The Sun’s brightness will increase by
about 1,000 times. It will do this because the surface area will radiate more
light. Its outer layers will then drift off into space to form a planetary
nebula. The core will remain behind as a fading white-dwarf star.<o:p>
